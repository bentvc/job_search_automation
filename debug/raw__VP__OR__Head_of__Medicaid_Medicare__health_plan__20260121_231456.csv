We call this “care beyond medicine.” We have turned the doctor’s office into a comprehensive care center.

We make the most important services available to our members under one roof. This includes a pharmacy, X\-rays, a blood lab, nutrition services, urgent care, and much more.

How To Stay Safe

In some instances, these individuals may even contact applicants with a job offer letter, ask applicants to make purchases (i.e., a laptop or gift cards) from a designated vendor, have applicants fill out W\-2 forms, or ask that applicants ship or send packages of goods to the company.
Avēsis would never make such requests to applicants at any time throughout our job application process. We also would never ask applicants for personal information, such as passport numbers, bank account numbers, or social security numbers, during our process. Our recruitment process takes place by phone and via trusted business communication platform (i.e., Zoom, Webex, Microsoft Teams, etc.). Any emails from Avēsis recruiters will come from a verified email address ending in @ Avēsiscom.
We urge all applicants to exercise caution. If something feels off about your interactions, we encourage you to suspend or cease communications. If you are unsure of the legitimacy of a communication you have received, please reach out to ITsupport@Avesis.com.
To learn more about protecting yourself from fraudulent activity, please refer to this article link (https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how\-avoid\-scam).

Boulder Care is an award\-winning digital clinic for addiction medicine, recognized for both innovation and high quality of patient care. Founded in 2017 by CEO Stephanie Strong, our mission is to improve the lives of people with substance use disorders through compassionate, evidence\-based care.  


We provide Boulder patients with a fully virtual, multidisciplinary care team—including medical providers and peer recovery specialists—who deliver personalized treatment, including medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and ongoing support. Our approach is grounded in clinical excellence, patient\-centered care, and a commitment to reducing barriers to recovery. Boulder partners with leading health plans, employers, and community organizations to ensure that our services are accessible and covered for the people who need them most.  


Named by Fortune as one of the Best Workplaces in Healthcare, we foster a culture of kindness, respect, and meaningful work that delivers outstanding patient outcomes and moves the addiction medicine industry forward.  


About this role  


We're looking for a senior value\-based contracting and health plan partnerships leader to own how payer deals are evaluated, structured, and executed, in close partnership with the VP of Payer Strategy.  


At Boulder, payer contracting execution means being responsible for deciding which deals are worth pursuing, shaping the economics and structure, and carrying them through to signed, workable contracts. You will be accountable for the quality, results of deals and revenue impact to Boulder \- not the number of meetings held or exploratory conversations without a clear path to sustainable deal economics for both parties.  


You will drive two core deal motions across Medicaid and Commercial contracts:  


Renegotiation \& conversion  
Net\-New Market contracting support ensuring agreements are economically sound, operationally executable, and scalable over time  


This is not a pure sales role, although sales literacy, negotiation skills and strong executive presence are critical as you will be a key externally\-facing Boulder representative to the market. You will not be responsible for maximizing the number of payer meetings or inbound conversations, but for ensuring that payer work results in high\-quality, executable contracts that drive durable enterprise value.  


This role reports directly to the VP of Payer Strategy, who sets payer and go\-to\-market contracting strategy.  


What you'll do  


Execution Ownership  


Enforce clear contract criteria before organizational time or resources are committed  
Prevent unqualified or low\-ROI opportunities from consuming payer, executive, or cross\-functional bandwidth  
Ensure every active opportunity has a defined deal hypothesis, economic model, decision\-maker map, and execution path  
Slow, redirect, or stop conversations that do not align with Boulder's payer strategy or value\-based contracting priorities  


Renegotiation, Conversion \& Economic Stewardship  


In partnership with VP, Payer Strategy, lead conversion of existing FFS contracts to value\-based arrangements  
Own end\-to\-end execution of negotiated health plan contracts, from strategy through sales motion to contract signature and implementation readiness, with accountability for long\-term contract sustainability and mutually derived value  
Exercise judgment in managing renegotiation dynamics and payer relationships, including political, operational, clinical, and economic constraints.  
Define what analytics and financial modeling is needed for each deal and partner closely with Finance, Analytics, Clinical, and Ops to ensure alignment  
Ensure consistency across contracts, narratives, and payer expectations  
Structure value\-based proposals and contracts (pricing, quality metrics, downside risk, guardrails)  
Hold the line on PMPMs and long\-term economics, as well as internal ""go / no\-go"" thresholds for deals  
Ensure contracts are implementable with Boulder Care's clinical and operational model  


Oversee Net\-New Market Contracting  


In partnership with the VP, apply disciplined judgment to net\-new market opportunities, ensuring only strategically aligned, economically sound deals advance  
Assist in deal strategy and mechanics and synthesizing market intelligence  
Support in prioritization of time and ensure deals advance through a structured sales motion  
Support executive\-level outreach and early\-stage negotiations  
Know when and how to leverage executive sponsorship (VP / CEO, SVP Medical Affairs)  
This role retains deal authority and economic accountability but does not act as the primary hunter for net\-new markets  


What you bring  


7–12 years in payer contracting, consulting, value\-based care, or health plan \- provider partnerships required  
Direct experience with managed care organizations (whether Medicaid, Medicare, or Commercial)  
Strong understanding of:  
Alternative payment models and provider contracting mechanics  
How plans think about costs, quality metrics, population health and network contracting  
Proven ability to say ""no"" to bad economics; strong executive decision\-making and judgement, solution orientation  
Ability to work cross functionally (not a lone wolf)  
Strong communication skills and executive presence  
Analytical and detail\-oriented;  
Strong execution orientation; this role informs strategy but is primarily accountable for pipeline progression, deal quality, and long\-term economic outcomes.  


Nice to have but not required  


Experience in Medicaid, behavioral health or complex care models  
Direct sales or business development experience or, at minimum, exposure and literacy around pipeline\-driven sales motion  
Experience at high\-growth digital health or healthcare startups  
Team management experience  


Work environment  


This is a fully remote role but we are currently only hiring candidates located in the following states: AZ, CA, FL, GA, ID, IL, KY, MA, NC, NJ, NY, OH, OR, PA, SC, TN, TX, UT, WA, and WV. Applicants must reside and work in one of those states to be considered.

Belle is a fast growing engagement company that is revolutionizing home healthcare – and it all begins with the feet. With 25M\+ U.S. seniors no longer able to see or reach their feet, a lack of self care and mobility challenges cost the health insurance plans $38B\+ in preventable medical spending every year.


Belle trains and manages a network of nail technicians or “Belle Technicians” who provide in\-home foot care (aka medical pedicures). Belle uses cutting edge data science to identify those most in need on behalf of health plans and deploys its services accordingly. While in the home, Belle Technicians complete assessments and screenings, often being the first to identify emerging issues below and above the knee. As these issues arise, a team of remote nurses coordinate care with other healthcare providers \- preventing serious and costly episodes.

**About The Role**
 We are looking for a versatile and highly experienced
 **Senior Product Data Analyst** 
 to join our team. Reporting to the VP of Product \& Data, you will play a foundational role in building our data tech stack, shaping our data culture, and helping build innovative data\-driven products.
   

  

**Our Data team is not a service desk.** 
 We operate as a product team, building the data assets that help us innovate on product and maintain high growth. You will replace ""gut feel"" with scalable, self\-serve data assets—such as version\-controlled dbt models, certified semantic layers, and predictive scoring mechanisms—that empower the wider organization to make decisions without constant intervention.
   

  

 This is a builder’s role. You will help define how we extract value from our data, turning raw inputs into a strategic asset. You won't just be running queries; you will be establishing trust in our numbers, helping select the right tools for our stack, and enabling the leadership team to make decisions with confidence.
   

  

 You will need to be comfortable working across the entire data lifecycle, and you must be willing to get your hands dirty first. On Monday, you might be scrubbing historical data to fix a discrepancy; on Tuesday, you might be answering ad\-hoc SQL questions for the Executive Team; and on Wednesday, you might be prototyping a proprietary predictive model to forecast service demand for our shops. We need someone who thrives in ambiguity and values speed, clarity, and truth.
   

  

**You Will**
* Establish Trust and Cleanliness (The ""Dirty Work""): We are transparent: there is significant work to be done to clean our data before the ""fun"" analysis can begin. You will proactively find the messiness in our data sources and identify gaps in our tracking. You understand that rigorous data cleaning is the prerequisite to interesting modeling.
* Build the Modern Stack (BI as Code): You will treat analytics like software. You will help us choose and deploy dbt (data build tool) and a modern BI platform, building version\-controlled models and CI/CD pipelines to ensure our data logic is tested, documented, and reliable. You will utilize modern AI tooling (Copilot) to accelerate development, actively working to reduce build times and optimize costs as we scale.
* Enable Self\-Service via ""Explore"" Environments: You will not just build dashboards; you will implement ""Explore"" environments and certified semantic layers that allow non\-technical stakeholders to answer their own questions safely.
* Master Three Data Domains: You will be responsible for synthesizing insights across three critical areas:
+ The Unified Customer View: You will tackle our biggest data challenge—joining disparate data sets (Product data, HubSpot CRM, and Chargebee billing) to create a single, trusted view of the customer. You will enable us to answer ""Who is using the product, are they paying, and are they happy?"" in one query.
+ Leadership \& GTM Strategy: You will partner with Sales, Marketing, and CS leadership to present high\-level business metrics (funnel health, retention trends), ensuring our executives are navigating with a clear dashboard.
+ Product Data: Analyzing feature adoption and user behavior to support Product Managers.
+ Shop Health \& Industry Trends: You will analyze aggregate data on how our customers' businesses are performing. Your insights will allow our CS and Marketing teams to act as trusted advisors to shop owners, help Product build the right tools to solve shop problems, and position our company as the industry expert on automotive trends.

* Master Event\-Based Analytics: You will go beyond transactional SQL. You will define and analyze the user journey through clickstream data, distinguishing between ""active users"" and ""engaged users"" to drive our product innovation.
* Collaborate with Engineering: You will act as a strategic partner, not a siloed analyst. While we have Data Engineering support to help move the bits, we rely on you to define the logic. You will work directly with software engineers to define tracking specifications (schema design) before features are shipped.
* Drive Data Culture: You will move the company away from ""gut feel"" and reliance on ad\-hoc CSV exports. You will train stakeholders on how to use data, helping them understand the difference between a ""vanity metric"" and a ""growth lever.""


**You Have**
**Must Have**
* 8\+ years of experience in product analytics, analytics engineering, or data science.
* The ""Modern Analyst"" Toolkit: You are comfortable with Command\-Line Interfaces (CLI), Git\-based version control, and CI/CD pipelines. You understand that modern analytics is a software engineering discipline.
* Deep dbt Expertise: You have extensive experience using dbt to build clean, tested, and documented data models. You know how to structure a project for scale.
* Event\-Based Analytics Mastery: You have deep expertise in analyzing user behavior (clickstream data) using tools like Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Heap. You understand the difference between analyzing transactions (SQL) and events (User Journeys).
* Builder Mindset: You have successfully built a stack (tools/processes) from scratch in a previous role. You don't wait for permission to fix broken processes.
* Data Quality Obsession: You spot when a number ""looks wrong,"" and you have the curiosity to dig in, find the root cause, and fix the definition.


**Nice To Have**
* Experience with ELT Tools: Familiarity with configuring modern connectors like Fivetran or Airbyte.
* AI/LLM Familiarity: Experience using LLMs to accelerate data exploration, generate semantic layers, or enhance productivity.
* Experience merging data from multiple product lines (e.g., post\-acquisition integration).
* Familiarity with the data schemas of Product databases, HubSpot, and Chargebee (or similar CRM/Billing platforms).
* Experience working with Snowflake.
* Background in B2B SaaS.
* Ability to commute to the Waltham office on occasion.


**Interview Process**
* Initial Screen (30min)
* Hiring Manager Interview (60min)
* Project Review and Mini Live Case Study (60min) \& Tech Screen (30min)
* Career Journey Interview (60min) and Executive Interview (30min)
* Reference Checks

* Generous Parental Leave

 Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.
   

  

 The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard\-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard\-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.
   

  

 Phaidra creates AI\-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:
   

  

* We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high\-value actions and decisions.
* We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well\-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
* We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


 Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.
   

  

 Phaidra's ability to achieve its mission is determined by our ability to work together — as defined by our core values:
 **Transparency** 
 ,
 **Collaboration** 
 ,
 **Operational Excellence** 
 ,
 **Ownership** 
 , and
 **Empathy.** 
 We seek individuals who embody these values, as they are instrumental in ensuring our team consistently delivers excellence and fosters an engaging and supportive culture

 **industrial digitalization, building AI** 
 and data solutions that solve some of the world’s hardest, highest\-impact problems. With unmatched industrial heritage and a comprehensive suite of AI capabilities, including low\-code AI agents, Cognite accelerates the digital transformation to drive operational improvements.
   

  

 Our moonshot is bold: unlock $100B in customer value by 2035 and redefine how global industry works.
   

  

 What Cognite is Relentless to achieve
   

  

 We thrive in challenges. We challenge assumptions. We execute with speed and ownership. If you view obstacles as signals to step forward \- not step back \- you’ll feel at home here. Join us in this venture where AI and data meet ingenuity, and together, we forge the path to a smarter, more connected industrial future.
   

  

 How you’ll demonstrate
 **Ownership**
 We're seeking a strategic talent architect—not a transactional recruitment leader. You view talent acquisition as a core competitive advantage and understand that recruiting elite engineering and commercial talent is fundamentally about investing in the company's long\-term trajectory, not filling seats today. You combine obsessive data discipline with genuine human insight, see obstacles as invitations to innovate, and thrive in environments where speed and rigor are non\-negotiable.
   

  

 If you've scaled TA from startup to scale\-up, navigated hypergrowth without compromising culture or quality, and believe that the best recruitment leaders are strategists first and operators second—this role is for you. As Talent Acquisition Director for Americas, you will lead, architect, and scale a world\-class recruitment engine serving North America, Latin America, and Canada. You'll own the end\-to\-end talent strategy that ensures Cognite has the elite engineering and commercial talent required to execute our industrial AI vision and hit aggressive regional growth targets.
   

  

**Strategic Talent Architecture**
* Multi\-Year Roadmap Execution: Design and execute a multi\-year TA strategy aligned with Cognite's product roadmap, go\-to\-market expansion, and organizational scaling milestones. You'll translate business growth plans into proactive talent pipelines, ensuring we're ahead of hiring needs, not chasing them.
* Future\-Proof Workforce Planning: Partner with Finance and P\&O to build predictive talent models that anticipate skill gaps 12–24 months forward, identify critical talent clusters (AI/ML engineers, technical sales, data scientists, go\-to\-market operators), and design non\-obvious sourcing and development strategies.
* Competitive Talent Intelligence: Act as the ""voice of the market"" to senior leadership. You'll provide quarterly talent market analysis, competitive intelligence on how top rivals recruit engineering and commercial talent, compensation benchmarking, and employer branding positioning that shapes Cognite's external narrative.


**Operational Excellence \& Systems Mastery**
* Data\-Informed Recruitment Model: Design and implement recruitment processes governed by real\-time analytics and AI\-powered insights. You'll establish a ""systems of record"" approach where ATS data, sourcing metrics, and hiring velocity drive all decisions—not intuition or historical practice.
* Recruiter Transformation: Re\-engineer the recruiter role for the AI era. You'll identify high\-potential team members and position them as strategic advisors and thought partners to hiring managers (moving beyond transactional sourcing), while systematizing routine sourcing and intake work through AI tools and workflow automation.
* Scale Without Quality Decay: Build operational frameworks (structured interview programs, assessments, etc.) that allow you to scale hiring velocity without compromising quality\-of\-hire, cultural fit, or candidate experience. Measure relentlessly: time\-to\-fill, quality\-of\-hire, offer acceptance rate, 6\-month and 12\-month retention, manager satisfaction.


**Executive Influence \& Complex Problem\-Solving**
* Strategic Advisory: Become the trusted advisor to VP and SVP\-level stakeholders on talent scarcity, market dynamics, and hiring trade\-offs. You'll recommend non\-obvious solutions to hard problems—e.g., ""We can't hire 50 ML engineers in this market; here's how we partner with universities and internal mobility instead.""
* Boundary\-Pushing Innovation: Design and pilot new TA initiatives—university relations programs, structured internal mobility frameworks, apprenticeship models for high\-potential non\-traditional candidates, contractor\-to\-FTE pathways—that expand our total addressable talent pool.
* Cross\-Functional Leadership: Lead P\&O, Finance, and business leadership through talent\-related challenges. You'll drive alignment on hiring budgets, compensation strategies, and headcount planning, ensuring that TA insights directly influence business strategy.


**Data Integrity \& Governance**
* Clean Data as Cultural Value: Champion data hygiene as a core team discipline. You'll establish standards for ATS data quality, activity logging, and reporting that enable every subsequent decision—AI\-powered sourcing, predictive analytics, and talent analytics—to rest on a foundation of high\-fidelity information.
* Systems Governance: Own the design and evolution of the TA tech stack (ATS, sourcing tools, assessment platforms, analytics). You'll ensure tools are configured as systems of record, not afterthoughts, and that data flows seamlessly between platforms for real\-time visibility and AI\-powered decision\-making.


 The Impact you bring to Cognite
   

  

* Culture of Shared Responsibility: You foster a culture of operational excellence by leading cross\-functional projects between TA, People \& Organization (P\&O), and Finance to align hiring plans with global business objectives.
* Recruitment Transformation Lead: You actively re\-engineer the recruiter persona for the AI era. By identifying the right talent within your team, you bridge the gap between transactional execution and Strategic Advisory, ensuring your best people are focused on high\-influence human interactions while automating the rest.
* Data Hygiene Discipline: You champion ""Clean Data"" as a core team value. You drive the discipline required to maintain a high\-integrity talent funnel, ensuring that every stage of the recruitment lifecycle is accurately captured and auditable.
* Boundary\-Pushing Problem Solving: You solve complex, ambiguous hiring challenges independently, designing new ways of operating such as University Relations (URR) programs and structured internal mobility frameworks.
* Leadership Presence: You navigate high\-stakes leadership environments with ease, providing the ""voice of the market"" to senior executives to shape compensation and branding strategies.
* Algorithmic Talent Intelligence: You move beyond basic analytics to lead ""evidence\-based hiring,"" leveraging predictive modelling and AI insights to forecast talent gaps, identify non\-obvious skill clusters, and de\-bias the selection process at scale.


**Required Qualifications**
* 10\+ years of progressive Talent Acquisition experience, with a significant portion (5\+ years) in fast\-scaling SaaS or AI\-focused technology environments, scaling from startup through growth stage.
* 3\+ years in a people leadership role with a proven track record of building, scaling, and upskilling high\-performance in\-house recruitment teams.
* Deep expertise in TA operations and strategy, including:
+ Sourcing strategy and talent pipelining (proactive vs. reactive recruitment)
+ Technical recruiting expertise (engineering, AI/ML, data science roles)
+ Commercial talent recruiting (sales, product, business development)
+ Recruitment metrics and analytics (time\-to\-fill, quality\-of\-hire, offer acceptance rate, retention cohort analysis)

* Demonstrated mastery of ATS systems (Greenhouse, Lever, or equivalent) and secondary TA tools. You understand how to configure, optimize, and extract data from these systems.
* Data\-informed decision\-making: Proven ability to design recruitment models governed by analytics, use forecasting and predictive modeling, and leverage insights to optimize hiring processes.
* Strong understanding of talent market dynamics, including competitive talent intelligence, labor market research, and workforce planning.
* Leadership presence in high\-stakes environments. You can present market insights to executives, influence compensation and branding strategy, and navigate complex stakeholder dynamics.


**Preferred Experience**
* Multi\-Market Expertise: Experience managing recruitment operations across multiple regions within the Americas (e.g., US, Canada, LATAM). More international and global experience is an advantage.
* High\-growth technology leadership: Prior TA leadership at pre\-IPO or high\-growth SaaS/AI companies scaling toward IPO or acquisition.
* AI\-powered recruitment tools: Exposure to or implementation of AI\-driven sourcing, predictive analytics, algorithmic skill\-matching, or bias\-detection tools in recruitment.
* Employer branding strategy: Built and executed recruitment marketing and employer brand campaigns that meaningfully improved talent quality and hiring velocity.

 The VP of Revenue Operations is responsible for building and leading an integrated revenue operations function that enables predictable and efficient growth across all go\-to\-market teams. The role aligns marketing, sales, technical success, and finance around a unified GTM strategy, standardized processes, and a single source of truth for revenue data, with particular focus on subscription / usage\-based DevOps software metrics (ARR, NRR, expansion, churn). The ideal candidate has a proven track record of scaling B2B SaaS or DevOps revenue operations from under $50M to over $ 250M in ARR.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Partner with the CRO and executive team to define the multi‑year revenue strategy, including segmentation, coverage model, and capacity planning across direct, channel, and self‑serve motions.
* Lead the annual and quarterly GTM planning process: targets, territories, quotas, headcount plans, compensation design, and budget alignment across Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, and Partnerships.
* Develop and maintain a unified revenue performance framework (pipeline, conversion, cycle time, retention, expansion) to guide investment decisions and trade‑offs.
* Own the Revenue enablement program for all functions within the organization.
* Own end‑to‑end GTM process design from lead to renewal and expansion (lead management, qualification, opportunity management, deal desk, order management, handoffs to onboarding and CS, renewal playbooks).
* Standardize and continuously improve processes for different DevOps segments (e.g., PLG/self‑serve, mid‑market, enterprise, strategic accounts, MSPs/VARs) while preserving regional and segment flexibility where needed.
* Implement and govern clear operating cadences: QBRs, forecast calls, pipeline reviews, marketing performance reviews, and customer health reviews.
* Establish a single source of truth for revenue data across CRM, marketing automation, product telemetry, billing, and customer success platforms, with clear data definitions and governance.
* Build robust dashboards and analytics for pipeline health, forecast accuracy, cohort retention, product adoption, pricing/discounting, and sales productivity; turn insights into recommendations and action.
* Own the companywide revenue forecasting process (new, expansion, churn) and drive continuous improvements in accuracy, timeliness, and scenario modelling.
* Own the GTM tech stack strategy and roadmap (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot/Marketo, sales engagement, CPQ, CLM, CS platforms, data warehouse/BI, enrichment, routing, intent signals, PLG tooling).
* Ensure systems are designed and integrated to support DevOps‑specific motions such as trials, freemium, usage‑based pricing, marketplace transactions, and hybrid land‑and‑expand motions.
* Drive adoption, enablement, and change management for GTM tools, ensuring that teams use standardized workflows and that data quality remains high.
* Serve as the connective tissue between Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Product, and Finance to ensure alignment on ICP, segmentation, messaging, pricing/packaging, and lifecycle plays.
* Partner with Product and Product Marketing to translate product telemetry and usage data into account‑level signals and plays (upsell, expansion, save, migration) for GTM teams.
* Oversee Revenue Enablement (directly or via dotted line), ensuring onboarding, ongoing training, and playbooks are grounded in data and aligned to GTM priorities.
* Build and lead a high‑performing RevOps organization spanning sales operations, marketing operations, CS operations, systems/administration, analytics, and deal desk.
* Define clear charters, operating models, and SLAs for how RevOps engages with GTM leaders and internal stakeholders.
* Develop talent, foster a culture of experimentation and continuous improvement, and position RevOps as a strategic partner rather than a reactive service function.


**Your Background**
* 10–15\+ years in revenue operations, sales operations, GTM strategy, or related fields, including leadership roles in high‑growth B2B SaaS; strong preference for DevOps, developer tools, or infrastructure software.
* Proven track record owning revenue operations for businesses with recurring/usage‑based models (ARR/NRR), with responsibility across marketing, sales, and CS.
* Deep experience with GTM planning and execution: segmentation, territory and quota design, capacity modelling, comp plan design, and forecasting at scale.
* Demonstrated success building and scaling RevOps or similar teams, including hiring managers and senior ICs across systems, analytics, and process.
* Expert‑level proficiency with modern GTM systems (CRM, marketing automation, sales engagement, CS tools, CPQ, BI, data warehouse) and their integration patterns.
* Strong analytical and financial skills; comfortable working with executives and board‑level stakeholders on metrics, forecasts, and trade‑off decisions.
* Excellent communication, influencing, and change‑management skills in a highly cross‑functional, often remote/distributed environment.
* Experience in a product‑led or hybrid PLG/enterprise motion is a strong plus, especially where product telemetry and marketplace channels are central to GTM.

**Organizational Development , Southeast Region!**
 Imagine a place where who you are, where you're from or the circumstances that surround you don’t determine your access to experiences or opportunities. Now imagine a mission, created to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. The Boys \& Girls Clubs are making that vision a reality, in your community and communities around the world.
   

  

 Boys \& Girls Clubs of America is seeking a bold, enterprise\-minded
 **Vice President, Organizational Development** 
 to serve as the senior\-most leader for our Southeast Region.
   

  

 The Southeast Region is one of BGCA’s most dynamic, diverse, and strategically influential regions, spanning nine states, supporting 112 local organizations, and reaching hundreds of thousands of young people across rural, suburban, and metropolitan communities. The region includes some of BGCA’s largest and highest\-performing organizations, alongside emerging markets poised for transformational growth and generational impact.
   

  

 Marked by rapid population expansion, evolving economic corridors, and deep community need, the Southeast presents both extraordinary opportunity and increasing demand for world\-class youth development. From major metropolitan centers such as Atlanta, Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, Memphis, Nashville, Birmingham, and New Orleans to fast\-growing mid\-sized and rural communities, Clubs across the Southeast serve as anchors of stability, opportunity, and hope.
   

  

 This is not a traditional regional leadership role. It is a
 **CEO\-equivalent position** 
 . The Southeast Region is nationally recognized for its culture of collaboration, innovation, and people\-powered leadership, and for its bold commitment to Future Ready youth development, teen engagement, and region\-wide organizational transformation.
   

  

 The Vice President of the Southeast Region plays a pivotal role alongside BGCA’s Senior Leadership Team, helping inform enterprise strategy, shape national initiatives, and ensure the voices and needs of Southeast Clubs are represented at the highest levels of the organization.
   

  

 With significant travel up to 70%, this role offers a unique opportunity to remain deeply connected to the field, building trusted relationships and shaping the future of youth\-serving organizations across the region.

 This role represents the
 **next evolution of what’s possible** 
 in the Southeast: scaling proven success, modernizing support models, and elevating leadership capacity across Boards, CEOs, and senior teams.

The Southeast Field Operations team brings expertise across financial acumen, resource development, executive leadership, and organizational strategy.

**Enterprise \& Movement Leadership**
* Serve as BGCA’s primary strategic partner to Southeast CEOs, Boards, and senior leadership teams.
* Translate national strategy into regional execution while respecting local autonomy and context.
* Represent the Southeast Region within BGCA’s senior leadership forums, informing enterprise priorities and solutions.


**Organizational Growth \& Market Expansion**
* Lead new market entry and re\-entry, mergers, management agreements, and regionalization strategies.
* Guide long\-range growth planning to ensure sustainable, high\-quality Club expansion across rural, suburban, and urban communities.


**Performance Excellence \& Capacity Building**
* Strengthen governance, executive leadership, financial sustainability, and operational effectiveness across organizations of varying size and complexity.
* Serve as a trusted advisor during CEO transitions, board transformation, and moments of organizational inflection.


**Statewide Impact \& Collective Strategies**

* Partner with state alliances, philanthropic leaders, and civic stakeholders to expand reach and resources.


**Movement Solutions \& Shared Services**
* Accelerate adoption of data\-driven tools, shared platforms, and innovative service models that enhance organizational effectiveness and youth outcomes.
* Champion outcomes measurement and continuous improvement aligned with BGCA’s Formula for Impact.


 Across all areas, this leader protects and elevates the BGCA brand, serving as a visible ambassador for the Movement and a strong advocate for children, families, and communities throughout the Southeast.
   

  

**Leadership Style and Measures of Success**
 Success in this role requires a leader who establishes clear direction, builds shared ownership for outcomes, and reinforces accountability through trust, transparency, and disciplined operating rhythms, remaining actively engaged at the moments that matter most. This leader leans in with intention and respect to remove obstacles, elevate performance, and ensure commitments deliver real, measurable impact.
   

  

 In the first 6 \- 12 months, this leader will navigate a complex and often divisive external environment, balancing stability with momentum while guiding organizations through peaks and valleys. Priorities include accelerating growth across rural and urban markets, strengthening organizational capabilities, and expanding resource development in close partnership with Clubs.
   

  

 Success will be measured by progress against BGCA’s strategic priorities, continued strengthening of local organizational capacity, and the ongoing evolution of the regional leadership team. Core competencies include focus, effective communication, empowerment through delegation, resilience, and agility, paired with the vision to capitalize on opportunity and scale what works.
   

  

 Above all, this leader inspires excitement and confidence in the future, particularly during periods of change, growth, or increased expectations, while fostering a culture grounded in trust, partnership, and shared ownership within a highly matrixed, mission\-driven environment.
