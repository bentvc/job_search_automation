**Own Integrations at the Point of Care**  

Design and build deep integrations with EHRs, payers, and post\-acute providers where reliability and performance matter.



**Make Foundational Technical Decisions**  

Drive stack selection, system design, and build versus buy decisions with an eye toward speed today and scale tomorrow.



**Build the Engineering Function from Zero**  

Hire, mentor, and lead the first engineering team. Establish best practices, code quality standards, and a strong shipping culture.



**Shape Company Culture and Execution**  

As the first engineering leader, you will set the bar for ownership, velocity, and product thinking across the company.

 🏢 Company: l'entreprise
   

  

 💼 Type: Full\-time – Permanent
   

  

 💸 Attractive package, to discuss
   

  

**About L'entreprise**
 Founded in 2016 and based in Lausanne, Switzerland, the company's mission is to help organizations leverage satellite, aerial, or drone imagery to extract actionable insights using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
   

  

**What They Offer**
* Cloud\-native SaaS platform (“GeoAI”): users can design, train, deploy, and manage machine learning models for geospatial image analysis.
* No\-code interface: even non\-technical users can create models for object detection or change detection in images (e.g., buildings, solar panels, farmland, mining equipment).
* Strong focus on impact \& compliance: e.g., their ""Tracer” solution enables traceability of raw materials (wood, palm oil, soy) to monitor plots, define boundaries, and assess compliance with environmental regulations like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).
* Multi\-sector applications: agriculture, forestry, mining, urban planning, infrastructure, supply chains.


**Example Projects**
* A raw materials sourcing company used this solution to analyze over 500,000 plots to assess deforestation risks and ensure EUDR compliance in its supply chain.
* An agriculture company monitored more than 90,000 farms to track soil health, erosion, and water retention across its supply chain using the company's GeoAI platform.


**Benefits / Why It’s Useful**
* Time \& cost savings: automation and no\-code interface significantly reduce development time compared to traditional geospatial image analysis methods.
* Improved visibility \& decision\-making: organizations move from periodic reports to continuous monitoring (e.g., plots, forests, infrastructure) and can act more agilely.
* Accessibility: by making geospatial AI more “mainstream,” l'entreprise enables use cases in sectors without highly specialized data science teams.


**Company Context**
* High\-growth scale\-up: last year, the company scaled from deals of €40–50k to deals of €1M\+ and is now almost exclusively targeting Enterprise clients.
* Two priority markets: France, UK, Nordic countries.
* Sales team in place: a few Sales in Switzerland and one in the US. This role currently reports to the CEO.


**The role: Enterprise Account Executive – UK**
 Reporting directly to the CEO, you would play a key role in the company's growth with strategic accounts in the UK. You would manage Enterprise accounts with
 **complex sales cycles (6–12 months)** 
 and average deals of several hundred thousand euros.
   

  

**Main Responsibilities**

* Build and maintain a strong pipeline from the first months.


**Full sales cycle management**
* Qualification, product demonstration, negotiation, and closing.
* Engage with multiple stakeholders, from VP/Director level to operational users.


**Sales growth \& team structuring**
* Contribute to establishing best practices and building a scalable Enterprise Sales model.


**Candidate Profile**
 🎯
 **Must\-have**
* Minimum 5 years of B2B sales experience, ideally in Enterprise SaaS or complex tech solutions.
* Experience managing long, multi\-stakeholder sales cycles (6–12 months).
* Proven ability in outbound prospecting and closing six\- or seven\-figure deals.
* “Challenger” mindset: curious, ambitious, autonomous, initiative\-driven.
* Excellent communication; native English required (a second European language is a plus).
* Experience in the UK market.


 💎
 **Nice\-to\-have**
* Knowledge of geospatial sector, AI applied to imagery, or environmental compliance (EUDR).

**Why join l'entreprise?**
* Unique, differentiating technology in a rapidly evolving sector (geospatial \+ AI \+ compliance).

* Opportunity to build the Enterprise Sales function in a growing organization.

The right person will bring structure, clarity, and purpose to our sales engine by creating a scalable system that enables sustainable growth, high\-performance habits, and measurable results.

 : Hire for potential and coachability over experience. Foster a culture where accountability, curiosity, creativity, and development are celebrated.
* Evolve Sales Messaging and the Value Story
 
 : Enable our team to articulate clear differentiators and proof points that go beyond “speed and quality of delivery” to demonstrate true business and bottom\-line impact.
* Drive Operational Rigor

* Champion Change and Transformation
 
 : Lead the organization through evolution—establishing buy\-in, setting direction, and creating alignment across leadership and sales teams.



  





**What You’ll Bring:** 



* Displayed ability to, and historical evidence of, transforming sales organizations through structured change—not just running a system that already exists.

* History of building alignment, accountability, and adoption across teams.
* Strong command of sales process design, qualification rigor, and pipeline management.
* Experience aligning compensation, metrics, and activity to outcomes and strategic goals.
* Comfort leading through ambiguity and resistance; ability to balance empathy with performance expectations.
* A belief in hiring for acumen and attitude—coachable, ambitious people capable of growth.
