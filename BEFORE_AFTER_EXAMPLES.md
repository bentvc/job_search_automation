Subject: Scaling US Sales for Heidi's AI Care Partner Amid Rapid Global Expansion

Dear Hiring Team,

Heidi Health's recent $65M raise to accelerate global expansion - powering 10M+ consults 
monthly across 116 countries - marks a pivotal moment for US market penetration, especially 
as you're hiring to build out sales leadership. With healthcare systems modernizing care 
delivery through AI like your scribe and workflow tools, bridging enterprise sales cycles 
with health systems like the NHS and Beth Israel Lahey will be key to sustaining momentum.

As a senior enterprise sales leader with 15+ years building $90M+ books of business in 
payer/health plan segments (Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, commercial), I've closed multiple 
7-figure, multi-year SaaS contracts in complex, long-cycle deals. My expertise in driving 
pipeline generation, GTM strategy, and executive relationships directly aligns with leading 
your US sales function - overseeing SDRs, AEs, and Solution Architects to acquire, expand, 
and retain customers across providers and payers.

I've thrived in ambiguity, translating vision into velocity while scaling teams and 
processes for predictable growth. I'd welcome a conversation on how my track record can 
support Heidi's US ambitions.

Best regards,
Bent Christiansen

Subject: Scaling US Sales Post-$65M Raise

Hi [Name],

Congrats on the $65M raise - powering 10M+ consults across 116 countries is impressive scale.

The way I'm reading this, the next challenge is creating a repeatable enterprise sales motion 
across diverse health systems (NHS, Beth Israel, and others like them). Am I reading this right?

I've helped two healthtech companies navigate this exact transition - from early traction to 
predictable enterprise sales. Specifically, I've built out the team structure (SDRs, AEs, SAs) 
and the processes for 7-figure deals in complex, long-cycle environments.

Curious if that's the phase you're in? Worth a brief chat Thursday to explore if this 
experience applies?

Best,
Bent

- ✅ Soft CTA ("Worth a brief chat")

## Example 2: Strategy Assertion

### ❌ BEFORE
```
Your company's rapid expansion into value-based care contracts will require building 
repeatable processes and training a distributed team across multiple geographies. 
Scaling the payer sales motion is critical for hitting revenue targets in 2026.
```

**Issues:**
- "will require" - prescriptive
- "is critical" - authoritative
- Telling them their business
- No questions

---

### ✅ AFTER
```
Based on what I'm seeing with the expansion into value-based care, my sense is that 
creating repeatable processes for a distributed team might be the next inflection point. 
Is that where you're headed?
```

**Improvements:**
- "my sense is" - tentative
- "might be" - not definitive
- Question invitation
- Shows expertise through insight

---

## Example 3: Problem Identification

### ❌ BEFORE
```
The challenge most healthtech companies face post-Series B is bridging the gap between 
product-market fit and scalable enterprise sales. You need to hire the right talent, 
build the sales infrastructure, and align incentives across product and sales teams.
```

**Issues:**
- "The challenge is" - assertive
- "You need to" - prescriptive
- Multiple "must do" statements
- No questions

---

### ✅ AFTER
```
I've noticed that post-Series B, the transition from founder-led sales to a distributed 
enterprise motion gets tricky - especially aligning product and sales incentives. Is that 
something you're navigating?
```

**Improvements:**
- "I've noticed" - experience-based
- "gets tricky" - acknowledges complexity
- Ends with question
- Invites them to share

---

## Example 4: Market Analysis

### ❌ BEFORE
```
With payers increasingly focused on value-based care and risk adjustment, your platform's 
capabilities in utilization management position you perfectly for this market. Success 
requires deep relationships with clinical leaders and an understanding of reimbursement 
dynamics.
```

**Issues:**
- "Success requires" - prescriptive
- Explaining their positioning back to them
- No dialogue

---

### ✅ AFTER
```
With payers shifting to value-based care, I'm curious how your UM platform is resonating 
with clinical leaders versus CFOs. In similar deals I've worked, the reimbursement 
conversation often drives urgency - seeing that?
```

**Improvements:**
- "I'm curious" - question-based
- "seeing that?" - invites response
- Shows expertise through question
- Creates dialogue opening

---

## Example 5: Credentialing

### ❌ BEFORE
```
As a senior enterprise sales leader with 15+ years of experience building $90M+ books 
of business in payer segments including Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and commercial plans, 
I've successfully closed multiple 7-figure, multi-year SaaS contracts. My expertise in 
pipeline generation, GTM strategy, and executive relationship building directly aligns 
with the challenges your organization faces.
```

**Issues:**
- Resume dump
- "directly aligns" - presumptuous
- "expertise" - boastful
- No question, no dialogue

---

### ✅ AFTER
```
I've helped two payer-focused companies build their enterprise sales motions - specifically 
navigating Medicaid/MA contracts and those long, complex deal cycles. That background might 
be relevant for what you're building - curious if it is?
```

**Improvements:**
- Brief and specific
- "might be relevant" - tentative
- Ends with question
- Lets them judge fit

---

## Example 6: Follow-up Email

### ❌ BEFORE
```
Following up on my previous message regarding the enterprise sales leadership role. 
Given your company's growth trajectory and the need to scale your sales organization, 
I believe my experience would be valuable. Let me know if you'd like to schedule a call.
```

**Issues:**
- Formal "following up"
- "the need to" - prescriptive about their needs
- "I believe" - self-focused
- "Let me know" - puts burden on them

---

### ✅ AFTER
```
Quick bump on this - curious if the timing works for a brief conversation about the 
enterprise sales motion? Still seeing that as a priority or has focus shifted?
```

**Improvements:**
- Brief and casual
- Question-based
- Acknowledges priorities might shift
- Easy yes/no

---

## Pattern Summary

### Authoritative → Consultative Transformations

| ❌ Authoritative | ✅ Consultative |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "You need to X" | "Curious if X is on the roadmap?" |
| "This will require Y" | "Does this hinge on Y?" |
| "The challenge is Z" | "My guess is Z is tricky - seeing that?" |
| "Success requires A" | "Does success depend on A?" |
| "You should prioritize B" | "Is prioritizing B the move?" |
| "It's critical to C" | "C seems critical - am I right?" |
| "This aligns perfectly" | "This might be relevant - curious if it is?" |
| "I believe I can help" | "Worth exploring if this applies?" |

### Question Frameworks to Use

1. **"Am I reading this right?"** - Hypothesis testing
2. **"Does that resonate?"** - Checking alignment
3. **"Is that the challenge?"** - Problem identification
4. **"Curious if..."** - Experience-based inquiry
5. **"Seeing that?"** - Pattern validation
6. **"Sound right?"** - Confirmation seeking
7. **"Worth exploring?"** - Soft CTA
