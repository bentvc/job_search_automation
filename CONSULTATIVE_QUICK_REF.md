# Consultative Tone Quick Reference

## The Core Principle
**Show expertise through insightful QUESTIONS, not authoritative STATEMENTS.**

---

## ❌ AVOID: Authoritative Assertions

### Red Flag Phrases
- "will be key to"
- "must focus on"  
- "needs to prioritize"
- "is critical for"
- "should address"
- "requires building"
- "the challenge is"
- "success requires"

### Example (Bad)
> "With healthcare systems modernizing care delivery through AI, bridging enterprise sales cycles with systems like NHS and Beth Israel Lahey **will be key to sustaining momentum**."

**Problems:**
- Too definitive ("will be")
- Telling them their business
- No room for dialogue
- Sounds like a lecture

---

## ✅ USE: Consultative Questions

### Green Light Phrases
- "Am I reading this right?"
- "Does that resonate?"
- "Is that the challenge?"
- "Curious if..."
- "My sense is... sound right?"
- "It seems like..."
- "The way I'm reading this..."
- "I could be wrong, but..."

### Example (Good)
> "The way I'm reading this - it seems that creating a repeatable and predictable enterprise sales motion across diverse systems like NHS and Beth Israel will be key to success. **Am I reading this right?**"

**Strengths:**
- Tentative framing ("the way I'm reading")
- Shows insight through the question
- Invites dialogue
- Senior peer voice

## Question Frameworks

### 1️⃣ Hypothesis Testing
```
"[Observation]. Am I reading this right?"
"My sense is [insight]. Does that resonate?"
"It seems like [challenge]. Is that what you're facing?"
```

### 2️⃣ Experience-Based Curiosity
```
"In similar situations I've seen [X]. Is that something you're navigating?"
"When I worked with [company], [Y] emerged. Curious if you're seeing that?"
```

### 3️⃣ Strategic Observation + Question
```
"With [their news], I'd imagine [implication]. Is that shaping priorities?"
"Given [their stage], [challenge] usually surfaces. Seeing that?"
```

### 4️⃣ Humble Expertise
```
"I could be wrong, but [insight]. Sound right?"
"This might not apply, but [observation]. Worth exploring?"
```

## Email Structure Template

### 1. Opening (Specific Hook)
> "Saw the news about the Series B - congrats!"

### 2. Hypothesis (Tentative Observation)
> "My sense is that scaling the payer sales motion post-raise is where things get interesting."

### 3. Credential (Brief & Relevant)
> "I've helped two companies navigate this exact transition - from early traction to predictable enterprise motion."

### 4. Question (Invite Dialogue)
> "Is that the phase you're in?"

### 5. Soft CTA
> "Worth a brief chat Thursday?"

## Tone Calibration

| Element | Target Level |
|---------|--------------|
| Confidence | 70% not 100% |
| Expertise Display | Through questions |
| Voice | Senior peer, not consultant |
| Energy | Curious, not urgent |
| Questions | At least 1-2 per email |

---

## Quick Self-Check

Before sending, ask yourself:

1. ✅ **Questions?** Does the email have at least one question?
2. ✅ **Tentative?** Are observations framed as hypotheses, not facts?
3. ✅ **Dialogue?** Does it invite a response or correction?
4. ❌ **Prescriptive?** Does it tell them what they "must" or "need to" do?
5. ❌ **Lecturing?** Does it explain their business back to them?

---

## Common Transformations

| ❌ Authoritative | ✅ Consultative |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "You need to build X" | "Curious if building X is on the roadmap?" |
| "Scaling will require Y" | "Does scaling hinge on Y?" |
| "The challenge is Z" | "My guess is Z is the tricky part - seeing that?" |
| "This is critical for success" | "This seems critical - am I off base?" |
| "You should prioritize A" | "Is prioritizing A the move here?" |

---

## Detection System

The system automatically flags:
- **Prescriptive language** without questions
- **Authoritative assertions** without curiosity markers  
- **Emails without questions** (3+ sentences)
- **Missing dialogue invitations**

You'll see warnings like:
- ⚠️ `prescriptive_will_be`
- ⚠️ `authoritative_without_curiosity`
- ⚠️ `no_questions_consultative_miss`

## Remember

> **A truly senior seller doesn't need to prove expertise through assertions. The quality of their questions does it for them.**

The question "Am I reading this right?" is more powerful than "This is what you need to do."
