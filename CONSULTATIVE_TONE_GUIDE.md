# Consultative Tone Framework for Email Generation

## The Problem
AI-generated emails often sound overly confident and authoritative when discussing a prospect's strategy or challenges. This creates several issues:
1. **Presumptuous**: Outsiders telling insiders their business
2. **Pedestrian**: Stating obvious facts that insiders already know
3. **Monologue not dialogue**: Doesn't invite response or correction
4. **Inauthentic**: Senior sellers use hypothesis-driven questions, not assertions

## The Solution: Consultative Question-Based Engagement

### BAD (Authoritative Assertion)
```
"With healthcare systems modernizing care delivery through AI like your scribe and workflow tools, 
bridging enterprise sales cycles with health systems like the NHS and Beth Israel Lahey will be 
key to sustaining momentum."
```

**Problems:**
- Too definitive about their strategy ("will be key")
- Sounds like you're lecturing them
- No room for dialogue or correction
- Suggests you know their business better than they do

### GOOD (Consultative Question)
```
"The way I'm reading this - it seems that creating a repeatable and predictable enterprise sales 
motion across diverse systems like NHS and Beth Israel and a lot of others I know will be key to 
success. Am I reading this right?"
```

**Strengths:**
- Tentative framing ("the way I'm reading this")
- Shows domain knowledge through the insight itself
- Invites dialogue ("Am I reading this right?")
- Authentic senior advisor voice
- Opens door for prospect to correct/expand

## Question Frameworks for Emails

### 1. Hypothesis Testing Pattern
- "The way I'm reading this..."
- "Based on what I'm seeing..."
- "My sense is that..."
- "It seems like..."

**Close with:**
- "Am I reading this right?"
- "Does that resonate?"
- "Is that the challenge you're facing?"
- "Am I off base here?"

### 2. Experience-Based Curiosity
- "In similar situations I've seen [X challenge]. Is that something you're navigating?"
- "When I worked with [similar company], [Y pattern] emerged. Curious if you're seeing that?"
- "I've noticed [trend] tends to create [challenge]. How's that playing out for you?"

### 3. Strategic Observation + Question
- "With [their news/context], I'd imagine [reasonable implication]. Is that shaping your priorities?"
- "Given [their situation], my instinct says [insight]. Sound right?"
- "Knowing [their vertical/stage], [challenge] usually surfaces. Seeing that?"

### 4. Humble Expertise Pattern
- "I could be wrong, but..."
- "Not sure if this applies to your situation, but..."
- "This might not be relevant, but..."

## Tone Markers: What to Avoid

### 🚫 Authoritative Red Flags
- "will be key to"
- "is critical for"  
- "must focus on"
- "needs to"
- "should prioritize"
- "The challenge is"
- "Success requires"

### ✅ Consultative Green Lights
- "might be"
- "could be"
- "seems like"
- "I'm wondering if"
- "curious whether"
- "does that resonate?"
- "am I reading this right?"

## Structural Guidelines

### Email Body Structure
1. **Opening**: Hook with specific, timely context (funding, hire, expansion)
2. **Hypothesis**: Tentative observation about their likely challenge/priority
3. **Credential**: Brief, relevant proof you've solved similar problems
4. **Question**: Invite dialogue, seek confirmation/correction
5. **Soft CTA**: "Open to a brief chat?" not "Let's schedule a call"

### Tone Calibration
- **Confidence level**: 70% not 100%
- **Expertise display**: Through questions not assertions
- **Voice**: Senior peer offering perspective, not consultant prescribing solutions
- **Energy**: Curious and engaged, not urgent or pushy

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Strategy Assertion
❌ **Before**: "Scaling your payer sales motion will require building repeatable processes and training a distributed team."

✅ **After**: "My instinct says the next challenge is creating repeatable processes for a distributed team - especially across payer segments. Is that where you're headed?"

### Example 2: Market Knowledge
❌ **Before**: "Value-based care contracts are becoming critical for health plans, making your platform essential."

✅ **After**: "With the shift to value-based care accelerating, I'm curious how health plans are responding to your platform. Seeing traction there?"

### Example 3: Problem Identification
❌ **Before**: "Your company needs to bridge the gap between product-market fit and scalable enterprise sales."

✅ **After**: "Going from early traction to a predictable enterprise motion - that transition is tricky. Is that the phase you're in?"

## Implementation Notes

### For LLM Prompts
Include these instructions:
1. **Tone**: Write as a senior advisor offering perspective, not a consultant prescribing solutions
2. **Question-based**: End strategic observations with questions that invite dialogue
3. **Tentative language**: Use "seems like," "my sense is," "am I reading this right?"
4. **Avoid absolutes**: Replace "will be key" with "might be critical" or reframe as question
5. **Credential placement**: Brief and specific, not exhaustive resume dump

### For Validation
Flag these patterns for review:
- Sentences with "will be," "must be," "is critical" without question mark
- Multiple authoritative statements without any questions
- No curiosity markers ("curious," "wondering," "seems like")
- Close without question or dialogue invitation

## Key Principle

**Show expertise through insightful questions, not authoritative statements.**

A truly senior seller demonstrates domain knowledge by asking questions that only an expert would know to ask. The question itself proves the expertise.
